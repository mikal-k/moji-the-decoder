# How to Write Tests for Your Moji Project with Jest and Supertest

## Introduction
Writing tests for your Moji project ensures reliability, reduces errors, 
and streamlines the development process. In this guide, we'll explore how 
to write tests using Jest and Supertest in a simple and efficient manner.

## Step 1: Set up Jest and Supertest
- Make sure Jest and Supertest are installed as devDependencies in your 
  project's `package.json` file.
- Create a `jest.config.js` file to configure Jest for your project.

## Step 2: Understand the structure of tests
- Tests typically consist of test suites and test cases.
- Test suites group related test cases together.
- Test cases are individual tests that check a specific functionality or 
  behavior.

## Step 3: Organize tests in your project
- Create a `test` folder in your project's root directory.
- Write test files with a `.test.js` extension, such as `moji.test.js`.
- Group related tests in the same file or create subfolders for different 
  modules.

## Step 4: Write a test suite and test cases
- Begin with importing the necessary modules:
  - `const request = require('supertest');`
  - `const app = require('../index.js');`
- Write a test suite using `describe()`:
  - `describe('Test the root path', () => { /* test cases go here */ });`
- Write test cases using `test()` or `it()`:
  - `test('It should return 200 OK', async () => { /* test implementation */ });`

## Step 5: Write assertions for your test cases
- Use Jest's built-in `expect()` function to check expected results.
- Chain matchers like `toBe()`, `toEqual()`, or `toContain()` to define 
  expected outcomes.
- Example: `expect(response.statusCode).toBe(200);`

## Step 6: Test asynchronous code
- Use the `async` keyword for the test function.
- Use the `await` keyword when making API calls with Supertest.
- Example: `const response = await request(app).get('/');`

## Step 7: Test different scenarios
- Test for success, failure, and edge cases.
- Check for proper error handling and error messages.

## Step 8: Clean up resources after tests
- Use the `afterAll()` or `afterEach()` hooks to clean up resources.
- Close any open connections or server instances.
- Example:

afterAll(() => {
  server.close();
});

## Step 9: Run tests
- Add a test script to your `package.json` file:
- `"test": "jest --detectOpenHandles"`
- Run tests with the command `npm test`.

## Step 10: Maintain and expand your tests
- Update tests as your project grows and evolves.
- Write new tests for new features or changes in behavior.
