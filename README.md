# User Interface (UI) Changes:
The latest update to Moji The Decoder has introduced several new changes to the user interface to improve the visualization of Zero Width Joiner (ZWJ) emojis. Notable changes include:

- **Character Segmentation Display**: ZWJ emojis are now displayed in distinct boxes for each joined character, enabling better representation and understanding of the emoji composition.
- **Modifier Information**: Enhanced display for emojis with skin tone or other modifiers, which shows both the visual representation and a textual description of the modifier in the corresponding box.
- **Emoji Component Information**: Each emoji component box now additionally provides the name and Unicode code point, and if the component name is unrecognized, a placeholder text 'Character not recognized' is shown.
- **Layout and Design**: The boxes are designed for readability with sufficient spacing and clear labeling, and the interface is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.
- **User Interface Feedback**: Success and error feedback messages guide users through their interactions with the application, ensuring a smooth user experience.
